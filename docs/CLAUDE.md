## What This Project Is

This is **Alex Oswald's resume builder** — a two-repo system for producing tailored,
interview-ready resumes across multiple job families from a single source of truth.

- **Repo 1: `resume-latex/`** — The LaTeX project that defines visual design and styling.
  Built using a custom `cv-style.cls` (Roboto fonts, navy header, sidebar layout, TikZ).
  This is the design substrate. It compiles to PDF via XeLaTeX.

- **Repo 2: `resume-builder/`** — A Python pipeline that reads YAML content, selects and
  tailors bullets per job family (and optionally per job posting via Claude API), renders
  a Jinja2 LaTeX template, and compiles to PDF. YAML is the source of truth. The `.tex`
  files in `output/` are generated artifacts — never manually edited.

Read `COMPANY_CONTEXT.md` for the full strategic picture.
Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for current status and remaining work.

## The Six Job Families

| ID   | Label                | Make Target  | Primary Audience                        |
|------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| DS   | Data Scientist       | `make ds`    | DS/ML roles, product science teams      |
| DA   | Data Analyst         | `make da`    | Analytics, BI, insights roles           |
| AE   | Analytics Engineer   | `make ae`    | dbt/pipeline/data modeling focused      |
| DE   | Data Engineer        | `make de`    | Infrastructure, pipelines, warehousing  |
| MLE  | ML Engineer          | `make mle`   | Production ML systems, MLOps            |
| ECON | Economist            | `make econ`  | Research, causal inference, policy      |

Note: `sections/aside-pg*-am.tex` is a people-management (Analytics Manager)
variant of the DA family. It is selected manually — not via a family ID — see
the file headers for when to use it instead of `aside-pg*-da.tex`.

## Key Conventions

### YAML bullet schema (always follow)
```yaml
- id: unique_snake_case_id      # referenced by families/*.yaml
  text: >                        # neutral base text
    Bullet content here.
  families: [DS, DA, AE]         # which families include this
  keywords: [keyword1, kw2]      # ATS terms
  tier: 1                        # 1=headline, 2=supporting, 3=contextual
  exclude_from: [ECON]           # optional override suppression
  variants:                      # only when framing concept changes per family/mode
    DA: > DA-specific rewrite
    ECON: > ECON-specific rewrite
    GAMES: > Games-industry rewrite (used when --industry games, no family variant)
```

### Role summary_variants (always follow)
```yaml
roles:
  - id: some_role_id
    summary: >
      Neutral base role description.
    summary_variants:            # optional per-family role descriptions
      DS: > Data science framing of this role.
      DA: > Analytics framing of this role.
```

### Tier rules
- **Tier 1** — Headline achievements. Always included. Quantified outcomes preferred.
- **Tier 2** — Strong supporting context. Include if space/relevance allows.
- **Tier 3** — Background detail. Include only when space is generous or highly relevant to posting.

### The variants field — use sparingly
Write the base `text` neutrally. Only add a `variants` block when the **framing concept** 
changes across families — not just the tone. Claude's revoicing handles tone; `variants` 
handles concept shifts (e.g., a causal inference bullet that reads as "model evaluation" 
for DS but "quasi-experimental study design" for ECON).

### Generated files — never manually edit
Everything under `output/` and any `.tex` in `postings/` is generated. Edit the YAML 
instead and re-run the build.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Validate YAML integrity
make validate

# Build base resume for a family
make ds          # → output/data_scientist/resume.tex
make da
make ae
make de
make mle
make econ

# Build games-industry variant (uses GAMES bullet variants + games summary/persona)
make ds-games    # → output/data_scientist/resume_ds.tex (games framing)
make da-games
# (all six families have -games variants)

# Build posting-tailored resume (calls Claude API for ranking + revoicing)
make posting F=data_scientist P=postings/acme_ds/posting.txt

# Build posting-tailored games resume
make posting-games F=data_scientist P=postings/ea_ds/posting.txt

# Build + compile to PDF
make pdf F=data_scientist

# Build all six base resumes
make all
```

### Key CLI flags (build.py)

| Flag | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--family` | `data_scientist`, `data_analyst`, etc. | — | Target job family |
| `--industry` | `games`, `agnostic` | `agnostic` | Games-mode: uses GAMES bullet variants, games summary, games revoicing persona |
| `--posting` | path to posting `.txt` | — | Enables posting-tailored mode (Claude API scoring + revoicing) |
| `--education-mode` | `full`, `condensed` | family default | Override education display mode |
| `--certs-placement` | `education`, `aside`, `omit` | family default | Where certifications render |
| `--pdf` | flag | — | Run XeLaTeX after generating `.tex` |
| `--all` | flag | — | Build all six families |
| `--validate` | flag | — | Run YAML integrity checks only |

## LaTeX Compile Notes

The LaTeX project requires XeLaTeX (not pdflatex). Roboto fonts must be available 
system-wide. The `cv-style.cls` uses `\begin{aside}` via `textpos`, and `entrylist` 
uses `longtable` (updated from `tabular*` to support page breaks within entries).

To compile manually:
```bash
cd resume-latex/
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex  # second pass for cross-references
```

## Working in This Project — Reminders for Claude

1. **Read `SCHEMA.md` before editing any YAML** — it defines all required fields and 
   the `variants` contract precisely.

2. **Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` before starting new work** — it tracks what's done 
   and what isn't so work isn't duplicated or contradicted.

3. **Never edit generated files** — if something in `output/` looks wrong, fix the 
   YAML or the template, not the output.

4. **When adding bullets**, assign `families`, `keywords`, and `tier` — all three are 
   required. Run `make validate` after.

5. **When changing `cv-style.cls`**, test with a full XeLaTeX compile. The class has 
   interdependencies between the sidebar, header, and `longtable` entrylist.

6. **The Jinja2 template (`resume.tex.j2`) mirrors `cv-style.cls` layout** — changes 
   to one may need to be reflected in the other.

7. **Content lives in YAML, not `.tex`** — if you find yourself wanting to edit a 
   `.tex` content file in `resume-builder/`, you should be editing a YAML file instead.
